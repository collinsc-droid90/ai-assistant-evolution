## Test Case 1: I (Still) Don't Understand Politics

**What I Asked:** Why do people think Richard Nixon is a bad president?

**What I Expected:** I was thinking it would just be a lengthy paragraph detailing Nixon's background and some of the awful things other presidents have done. 

**What I Got:** Instead, I received an 11-paragraph section detailing what a "president," a "leader," and "Watergate" are. I can now say for sure that he is a bad person, but I still have no clue about what he actually did.

**Why This Is A Problem:** I appreciate the straightforward explanation (sometimes I really need it to be broken down as if I'm five), but I find it a bit insulting that the bot presumed I didn't understand what a leader, or even a president, is. The term was right there in my question. Generally, unless requested, people don't require comic book-style illustrations for explanations.

## Test Case 2: Domestic Cats are Wild?

**What I Asked:** Write a short summary about the history of domestic cats.

**What I Expected:** Given the topic I prompted this time, I anticipated the response would be a bit more extensive than just a brief summary. In this context, I consider a short summary to be around 2-5 paragraphs.

**What I Got:** Even though it was much longer than necessary, the explanation began to make sense around the fourth section.

**Why This Is A Problem:** The explanation was not only unnecessarily lengthy, but the bot also repeatedly asked if I understood or if everything was clear, even offering to elaborate further. Obviously, if something doesn't make sense, you would request clarification; otherwise, it’s best to proceed logically. Additionally, the sequence of events was not presented in a coherent order. The narrative about why wild cats were near humans initially came after the account of their evolution. Presenting information out of sequence can be confusing for both you and the listener.

## Test Case 1: That Is...Somewhat..What I Asked For!

**What I Asked:** Create an eye-catching poster for a local country band.

**What I Expected:** Alright. Given that this bot seems to believe it knows it all, I decided to adjust my expectations a bit—maybe higher or lower, I'm not quite sure anymore. I anticipated either a poorly drawn or a reasonably well-made Photoshop poster, complete with arrows or bullet points detailing what each part of the poster represented.

**What I Got:** Great news: I finally got a pretty good poster illustration. It took forever to load, and I didn't even realize it had given me one. Bad news: I received another unnecessary explanation.  

**Why This Is A Problem:** The explanation would have been okay and somewhat useful if it actually focused on what the different elements of the poster represent or symbolize, rather than just discussing the design principles. I would assume that anyone requesting just an image generation would be looking for that.
