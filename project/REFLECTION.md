# Reflection Questions

## About Your Process:

1. What was your biggest "aha moment" when working with AI this semester?

   The biggest "aha moment" was in Module Five, where we made the quick prototype. When I first prompted the AI tool, I figured that it would just give me a document that listed basic features 
   
    I didn't think that it would give me an actual prototype that I could use in a web browser

3. Describe a time when the AI gave you something useless. What did you do next?

4. How did your prompting approach change from Week 1 to now?
