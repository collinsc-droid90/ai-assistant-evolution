# Reflection Questions

## About Your Process: 🤔

1. What was your biggest "aha moment" when working with AI this semester?

   The most significant "aha moment" occurred in Module Five when we created the quick prototype. Initially, when I used the AI tool, I assumed it would only provide a document outlining basic features and some code. I never expected it to    actually produce a prototype, much less a functional one. Before taking this class, my experience with AI was mostly restricted to grammar checking and brainstorming ideas.
   
2. Describe a time when the AI gave you something useless. What did you do next?

   This example isn't connected to this class, but it's still important for understanding AI usage. For certain Photoshop tasks, I would utilize the "Generate Image" feature to create pictures that I couldn't locate (or I was too lazy to modify). I asked it to create an image of a cat playing with a yarn ball, but instead, it generated a leopard. I figured this was due to the background around it. Even though I wanted to use the image, the spots gave it a chaotic AI look, so I just asked for a black-and-white cat.

3. How did your prompting approach change from Week 1 to now?

   My skills in AI prompting have improved a lot thanks to these assignment practices. I used to think I could fit everything into just one or two sentences without realizing how important it was to be specific with my wording. Now, I see that using more sentences makes my writing not only more organized but also clearer.

## About What You Learned: ℹ️

1. What's one thing you can do with AI now that you couldn't do in August?

   In August, I really couldn't get AI to help me create a program prototype. One website I tried had a spinner to pick concepts, but I was clueless about how to make my own that I could tweak.

2. What surprised you most about working with AI tools?

   The most surprising part of using AI tools is their capabilities and the terms they use. AI can accomplish way more than what I've managed to do on my own. We can see the possibilities in everyday uses. It makes sense that we need to sort these potentials to understand them better. 

3. What's something AI is genuinely bad at that you discovered firsthand?

   I've noticed that with some AI tools, like ChatGPT, the program often gives you extra stuff beyond what you asked for. You might request a llama, and it ends up giving you a llama wearing a party hat. Most people know that AI has a hard time creating things like hands and hooves (which is honestly relatable because I can't draw hands very well either).

## About What's Next: 🤖

1. How might you use AI tools in your other classes or your job?

   As I mentioned earlier, I've mainly been using Claude (which I really enjoy) for coming up with design ideas and generating placeholder text. A lot of professional roles are seeking designers who are good at prompting because it makes things more efficient. Just like in the Module Five assignment, programmers and designers would probably use AI to create smaller design prototypes that are user-friendly and easy to build upon.

2. What would you tell a friend who's never used AI tools to help them get started?

   First, I would suggest they look into various AI tools to gain a better understanding of what they need from a specific program and how it operates. Then, I would recommend they practice their sentence prompting; the aim is to be clear and concise. Finally, I would emphasize that while AI is fantastic for efficiency, it shouldn't stop you from taking the time to learn a real skill. It's so common and accessible that people can notice when it's being used. Heck, AI is even used to detect AI. 

3. Is there anything you want to learn more about after this course?

   I'm really curious about how AI is applied in video games or household appliances. How does it remember player interactions, or how does the dryer know when your clothes are finished? That's some more advanced programming.
