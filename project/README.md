# Final Project README

## What is this? (2-3 sentences explaining your project idea) ❓

Many designers like myself spend hours, even days, struggling to develop fresh ideas for their projects. My MVP project is called the Inspirer, which is a web-based tool designed to help graphic designers overcome creative blocks and jumpstart their ideation process.

## What does it do? (Or what was it supposed to do?) 🙋

When you're staring at a blank canvas and need a creative spark, this app generates unique, structured design prompts by randomly combining three key elements:

- Design Style - An aesthetic direction (e.g., Minimalism, Pop Art, Brutalism)

- Target Audience - A specific demographic to design for (e.g., Gen Z, Small Business Owners, Healthcare Workers)

- Emotion/Concept - A feeling or message to convey (e.g., Nostalgia, Innovation, Confidence)


## How far did you get? (Be honest — "70% there" or "just a prototype" is fine) ☑️

Through hard work and hours of iterations, I was able to create a decent prototype that produces 8,000 prompt suggestions.

## What AI tools did you use? (Gemini, Claude, ChatGPT, Copilot, etc.) 🧰

Some AI tools that were used in my project iterations include Gemini and Claude for program development and Ahrefs for grammar and wording.
