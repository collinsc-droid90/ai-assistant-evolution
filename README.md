# The Inspirer MVP

## What It Does

The Inspirer is a web-based tool designed to help graphic designers overcome creative blocks and jumpstart their ideation process. When you're staring at a blank canvas and need a creative spark, this app generates unique, structured design prompts by randomly combining three key elements:

Design Style - An aesthetic direction (e.g., Minimalism, Pop Art, Brutalism)

Target Audience - A specific demographic to design for (e.g., Gen Z, Small Business Owners, Healthcare Workers)

Emotion/Concept - A feeling or message to convey (e.g., Nostalgia, Innovation, Confidence)

## What I Learned
Iteration is built on trial and error, which goes hand in hand with the importance of successful AI prompting. The more specific and clear your prompts are, the more accurate your results will be.

## Future Improvements

Because the program can produce 8,000 prompt suggestions, I wanted to keep things simple and not overload it with so much functionality.
