## Version 1: Google Gemini
✅ **Works:** 

- The webpage itself is functional and colorful.  
- Text is easy to read.  
- Project type selection.  
- “Inspire me” button.  
- The “Project” and “Design Prompt” are displayed in the results.  
- Results can be saved to favorites, and the last ten generations are saved.

❌ **Broken:** [list what's broken]

- This might just be a personal preference, but I don't like how the white background in the “Generate a New Prompt” section extends with the “History & Favorites” section. There’s nothing else below it, so it just looks empty.
