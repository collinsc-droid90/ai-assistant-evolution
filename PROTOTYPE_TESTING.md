## Version 1: Google Gemini
✅ **Works:** 

- The webpage itself is functional and colorful.  
- Text is easy to read.  
- Project type selection.  
- “Inspire me” button.  
- The “Project” and “Design Prompt” are displayed in the results.  
- Results can be saved to favorites, and the last ten generations are saved.

❌ **Broken:** [list what's broken]

- This might just be a personal preference, but I don't like how the white background in the “Generate a New Prompt” section extends with the “History & Favorites” section. There’s nothing else below it, so it just looks empty.

💭 **Observations:** [any interesting choices]

- I was given more project type and design style examples than I had listed. I also love the color scheme.

## Version 2: Claude.ai
✅ **Works:** [list what works]

- The webpage itself is functional and colorful.  
- Text is easy to read.  
- Project type selection.  
- “Inspire me” button.  
- The “Project” and “Design Prompt” are displayed in the results.
- The suggestion descriptions are shorter.  
- Results can be saved to favorites, and the last ten generations are saved.

❌ **Broken:** [list what's broken]

- Generations are limited to the examples given in the PRD; there are less combinations than the Google Gemini version.
- Once you delete a suggestion or remove a favorite item it's gone.
- The color palette and gradient, while not bad, look similar to other programs.

💭 **Observations:** [any interesting choices]

- Recent generations and favorites are in their own category.
- You have the option to delete generations instead of letting them fall behind the 10th generation.

## Decision
I'm going to go with the Claude.ai version because there are more specific interactive features.
